## Project description

This is our CSCI 325 team-based semester project. This program represents a restaurant ordering service and allows a user to select a restaurant and create a mock order from the menu based on the time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner menu). Previous reviews can be printed from a text file of the selected restaurant or the user can go straight to the menu. The menu will then be printed from a text file based on the selection. The user can then choose items to be added to their order and those items can be customized (Such as adding cheese etc.) Once the user is finished with their order, the userâ€™s itemized receipt will be printed based on everything they have selected. Then the user can add a tip (in percentage), select a method of payment (card, Venmo, PayPal, etc.), and make the payment. The order total plus tax and tip will be printed for the user. The user will then have the option to review the selected restaurant and add a rating. If the user decides to add a review, then the review will be stored in a text file so it can be viewed by other users.

## How to run the program

Once you have access to the repository, clone the repository or download the ZIP file and place it in the desired location on your computer. I recommend using Visual Studio code to run the project since I found this to be the easiest way. In Visual Studio, it should prompt you to download the Java language support if you do not already have it installed. If you do then you are good to go! You also must install the latest version of the JavaJDK library from this link: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/. Make sure to install the appropriate version for your OS.

Next, you must find the RestaurantMenu.java file in order to run the project. Expand the files RestaurantMenu, src, and open the RestaurantMenu.java file (screenshot below). This is the main file that the project will be run from.

When this file is opened, you can now run the project by clicking on the "Run Java" button at the top right of the screen. A terminal should appear and the project should be running! If you have any questions about running this project please contact me.

## UI Design

This Java project uses the command line to present the user with the different options for ordering from a restaurant menu. The user can first choose which restaurant they want to order from and the corresponding menu will be printed. They will also have the choice to see the previous reviews on the restaurant choice. The user can add as many items as they want to their order and the receipt will print before they enter their payment information and they will have the option to add a tip if they want. The final receipt will be printed with tax calculated and the payment information can be entered. After the order, the user will have the option to add a review if they choose and then the order will be completed! See the screenshots below for details.
