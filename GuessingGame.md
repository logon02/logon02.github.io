## Project description

This is my number guessing game written in Perl. This program generates a random number between 0 and 100 and allows the user to make a guess. It will tell the user if the guess is too high, too low, or the correct number. Try to guess it in under 10 tries!

## How to run the program

I found that Linux is the best OS to use when running this program since Perl is an older language and is no longer supported on some systems. Download the code from GitHub or clone the repository. Once you have the code ready, navigate to the file in the Linux terminal. Run the following commands:

```bash
$ chmod 755 guessingGame.pl
$ ./guessingGame.pl
```

The game should now be running in the terminal. Guess away!

## UI Design

This guessing game uses the CLI (command-line interface) to display the game to users. It is a simple UI and will ask the user to enter their name and will greet them. Then the user can begin guessing by entering a number and the game will display a message informing them if their guess was too high, too low, or spot on!

## 3. Additional Considerations

I would recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 or later to run this game because it comes with Perl pre-installed. Other versions or Linux distributions can be used but you may have some extra steps involved.
